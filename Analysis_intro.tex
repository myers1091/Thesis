This chapter will present the results of a search for Higgs boson pair production where one Higgs boson decays via ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ and the other via ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$. The ${WW^{*}}$ system decays into ${l\nu qq}$ (where ${l}$ is either an electron or a muon), with the small contamination from the leptonic ${\tau}$ decays not explicitly vetoed in the analysis. The Higgs boson decay modes chosen for this analysis are a compromise between signal efficiency and background reduction. The ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$ branching ratio of approximately 25\% is the second largest after ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ (approximately 58\%). The 1-lepton final state gives a strong discriminator against multijet background. The dominant backgrounds are \ttbar{} production, W bosons produced in association with jets (W+jets), and multijet events where a jet is misidentified as a lepton. There are smaller background  contributions from single top-quark production, Z bosons produced in association with jets (Z+jets), and diboson production.\newline

\indent This analysis sets limits on both SM Higgs boson pair production and on resonant production. Both production methods are discussed in detail in chapter \ref{chap:dihiggs}. Figure ~\ref{fig:res} shows a Feynman diagram of resonant production of the Higgs boson pairs with the subsequent decays ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$ and ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$.
