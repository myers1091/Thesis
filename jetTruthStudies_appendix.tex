\section{Jet Truth Studies}
\label{app:jetTruthStudies}
Truth studies were carried out to test the fraction of events in which the minimum $\Delta R$ between light jets is the correct hadronic $W$ boson candidate. Three signal mass points were tested - 700, 2000, and 5000 GeV resonances. It was found that in events where both the daughters of the hadronically decaying $W$ boson can be uniquely matched to reconstructed anti-kt4 resolved jets, minimum $\Delta R$  between jet-pairs pick the correct $W$ boson 70\% of the times. Figure~\ref{fig:minDeltaR_qq} shows the fraction of times in which the minimum $\Delta R$  between jet-pairs pick the correct $W$ boson for 3 different signal mass points.
