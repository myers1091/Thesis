A search for  resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in
the $b\bar{b}WW^\ast$ decay mode is performed in the $b\bar{b}\ell\nu qq$
final state using $pp$ collision data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 36.1~fb$^{-1}$, collected at $\sqrt{s}=13$~\TeV\ by the
ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No evidence of an excess of events
over the background expectation is found.
Limits are set on resonant production as a function of the resonance mass for a scalar resonance and for
spin-2 gravitons in the mass range 500 to 3000~\GeV.
An upper limit is set on the cross section of non-resonant pair production
$\sigma(pp \to HH) \cdot {\mathcal{B}}(HH \to b\bar{b}WW^{\ast}) < 2.5$~pb
at 95\% CL corresponding to  300 times the predicted SM cross
section. Given the result of this work, in order to bring
relevant sensitivity improvement to the $HH$ non-resonant SM searches
in this channel at the LHC and at future colliders, more advanced analysis techniques,
development of new methods for the normalisation of the $t\bar{t}$
background, and a more refined estimation of the multijet background, need to be deployed.
%These will be the subject of a future work.  %The analysis is dominated by systematics uncertainties, and
%advanced analysis techniques need to be used to enhance the
%sensitivity to a signal.
%This paper represents the first search for $hh$ pair
%production in the $bbWW^\ast$ decay mode in the single lepton plus jets
%topologies.
 
%The future iteration of the analysis will benefit from employing advanced techniques to enhance sensitivity to the signals, and to reduce the dominant systematic uncertainties.
 
%Limits on $\sigma \times
%\mathrm{BR}$ as a function of the $hh$ invariant mass are obtained in
%the mass range between 500 and 3000 GeV.
