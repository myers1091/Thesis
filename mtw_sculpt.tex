\section{Study of $m_{T}(W)$ Shape}
In this section, we show the study that investigates $m_{T}(W)$ distributions. 
In the resolved analysis, we find that the kinematic requirement on $m_{WW}$ of less than 130 GeV causes
the drop beyond $m_{W}$. While in the boosted analysis, this cut is not explicitly required, nevertheless Higgs mass constraint of 125 GeV is made to solve for neutrino longitudinal momentum. We also find that the earliest selection requirements such as \met and large-R jet requirement already cause this drop in the boosted analysis. To ensure that these requirements are causing the drop, we compare the $m_{T}(W)$ distribution at the loosest selection, taken from the resolved analysis but with selection similar to that in the boosted analysis. See Figure~\ref{mtw_res_boosted}, where we show the $m_{T}(W)$ distribution at the selection level of requiring a trigger matched lepton on the left, and compare to the $m_{T}(W)$ distribution after requiring \met and large-R jet in the boosted analysis.

For the left plot, the selection corresponds to requiring one trigger-matched lepton only with no further selection, while for the right plot, a large-R jet requirement of the analysis is made.}
