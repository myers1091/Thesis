\section{$b$-jet Correction}
We were asked to check the improvement in $m_{hh}$ resolution by scaling the $b$-jet energies by the Higgs mass mass constraint. The $b$-jet is energy is scaled by a factor of $m_{bb}/125$. The correction make little difference to the $m_{hh}$ resolution. See Figure~\ref{fig:mhh_res}.
