\section {$m_{hh}$ Resolution}

$m_{H}$ resolution for 4 signal mass points are obtained by fitting a Gaussian to the $m_{hh}$ distribution. The fit is performed at the end of the selection. The $m_h{h}$ resolution varies as a function of the signal mass, and ranges from about 30 (80) GeV for m500 (m1000) in the low-mass selection to about 250 (300) GeV for m2000 (m3000) in the high-mass selection.
Figure~\ref{hhMass_res} shows  $m_{hh}$ distributions and the fit results.
