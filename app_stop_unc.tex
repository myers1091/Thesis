\section {Additional Single Top Uncertainties}
This section shows the detailed comparison of nominal single top samples with the available alternative single top samples.

\caption{Expected event yields for nominal and alternative single top samples as recommended in the Top Group Twiki for non-resonance selection. In parenthesis are shown the relative uncertainties between the nominal and the alternative sample, in percentage, and the error on it. The alternative sample either doesn't pass selection or has little statistics beyond the last column selection.}
