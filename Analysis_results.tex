\subsection{Resolved analysis results}
\label{sec:results}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%Table~\ref{tab:event_yields}  shows the number of events selected by
%the full analysis cut chain excluding the $m_{hh}$ cut.
%The observed data are in good agreement with the expected background  except for the
%\emph{high-mass} selection,  where a 20\% excess is found. Nevertheless, this  excess is
%not significant due to the  30\% systematic on the background
%prediction.
 
The resolved analysis  is described in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:Resolved}. The event selection is described in
Section~\ref{sec:resolved_selection} and summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:sig_reg_summary}. For each selected event, the
invariant mass of the $HH$ system ($m_{HH}$) is reconstructed and its distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mhh_1} for the \emph{non-res} and the \emph{m500} analyses, and in Figure~\ref{fig:mhh_2} for the \emph{low-mass} and the \emph{high-mass} analyses.
%After applying the requirements listed in Table \ref{tab:sig_reg_summary},  the invariant mass of the $HH$ system ($m_{HH}$) is distributed as shown in Figures \ref{fig:mhh_1} and \ref{fig:mhh_2}.
Data are generally in good agreement with the expected
background predictions within the total uncertainty.
The signal $m_{HH}$ distribution is shown in the figure for the non-resonant and the scalar resonance.
%At this selection stage, the non-resonant signal shows a broad
%distribution in $m_{hh}$ concentrated below 1 TeV.
Because the scalar-resonance samples are simulated in the narrow-width approximation,  the
reconstructed resonance width is exclusively due to the detector
resolution. 
%causes a sensitivity loss for the last signal model.

\label{fig:mhh_2}
\end{figure}
 
 
The $m_{HH}$ distribution is sampled with resonance-mass-dependent
$m_{HH}$ requirements as reported in Table \ref{tab:mhh_sig_cuts}.
The numbers of events in the signal and control regions (the $t\bar{t}$
control region and the C region of the multijet estimation procedure) are
simultaneously fit using a  maximum-likelihood approach. The fit includes six contributions: signal, $W$+jets,
$Z$+jets, $t\bar{t}$, single-top-quark production, diboson and multijet. The
$t\bar{t}$ and multijet normalisations are free to float, the C
region of the ABCD method being directly used in the fit, while the
diboson, $W$+jets and $Z$+jets backgrounds are constrained
to the expected SM cross sections within their uncertainties.
 
The fit is performed after combining the electron and muon channel distributions. Statistical uncertainties due to the limited
sample sizes of the simulated background processes are taken into
account in the fit by means of nuisance parameters, which are
parameterised by Poisson priors. Systematic uncertainties are taken into account as
nuisance parameters with Gaussian constraints. For each
source of systematic uncertainty, the correlations across bins and
between different kinematic regions, as well as those between signal
and background, are taken into account.
Table~\ref{tab:event_yields_low} shows
the post-fit number of predicted backgrounds, observed data, and the
signal events normalized to the expected upper limit cross
sections. Expected event yields vary across mass because of varying selections. For instance, the requirement on $p_{\rm T}^{b \bar{b}}$ is higher in \emph{non-res} selection than in \emph{low-mass} selection. Similarly, even within \emph{low-mass} or \emph{high-mass} selection, the requirement on $m_{HH}$ vary across mass.

No significant excess over the expectation is observed and the results are used to evaluate an upper limit at the $95\%$
confidence level (CL)  on the production cross section times the
branching fraction for the signal hypotheses under consideration.
The exclusion limits are calculated with a modified frequentist
method~\cite{CLs_2002}, also known as CL$_{\mathrm{s}}$, and the
profile-likelihood test statistic~\cite{asymptotics}.  None of the considered
systematic uncertainties is significantly constrained or
pulled in the likelihood fit.
 
In the SM signal hypothesis the observed (expected) upper
limit on the $\sigma(pp \to HH) \times {\mathcal{B}}( HH \to b\bar{b}WW^{\ast})$ at 95\%
CL is:
\[
\sigma(pp \to HH) \cdot {\mathcal{B}}(HH \to b\bar{b}WW^{\ast}) < 2.5 \, \left
 (2.5^{+1.0}_{-0.7} \right )  \,
{\mathrm{pb}}.
\]
The branching fraction ${\mathcal{B}}(HH \to b\bar{b}WW^{\ast}) = 2\times
{\mathcal{B}}(H \to b\bar{b}) \times {\mathcal{B}}(H \to WW^{\ast}) = 0.248$ is used to
obtain the following observed (expected) limit on the $HH$ production cross section at 95\% CL:
\[
\sigma(pp \to HH) < 10 \, \left (10^{+4}_{-3} \right) \,  {\text{pb,}}
\]
 
which corresponds to 300~(300$^{+100}_{-80}$) times the SM predicted cross section.
Including only the statistical uncertainty, the expected upper limit for the non-resonant production is
190 times the SM prediction.
This result, when compared with other $HH$ decay channels, is not competitive.  This is mainly  due to the similarity of the reconstructed $m_{HH}$ spectrum between the non-resonant SM signal
and the $t\bar{t}$ background that makes the separation between the
two processes difficult.
 
Figure~\ref{fig:limit} shows the expected and observed limit
curves for the production cross section of a scalar $S$ particle.
Different selections are used in different resonance mass ranges without attempting to statistically combine them. The
switch from one selection to another is performed based on the
best expected limit for that resonance mass.
The outcome of this procedure is that the \emph{m500} selection is used to set limits on resonances of mass of 500 GeV,  the \emph{low-mass}   selection is used up to masses of 1600 GeV, while the \emph{high-mass} selection is used in the mass range 1600-3000 GeV.

Overall, the resolved analysis is most sensitive for a mass value of 1300~\GeV\ with an
expected upper limit of 0.35~pb on $\sigma(pp \to HH)$. At this mass the observed exclusion limit  is 0.2~pb.
%For the resonant hypothesis the expected and observed limits are
%shown in Figure~\ref{fig:limit}.
In both the non-resonant and resonant cases, the impact of the
systematic uncertainties is observed to be large.
In order to quantify the impact of the
systematic uncertainties, a fit is performed where the estimated
signal yield,  normalized to an arbitrary cross-section value, is multiplied
by a scaling factor $\alpha_{\mathrm{sig}}$, which is treated as
the parameter of interest in the fit.
The fit is performed using pseudo-data and the contribution to the  uncertainty in
$\alpha_{\mathrm{sig}}$ from several sources is determined. The contribution of the statistical uncertainty  to the total
uncertainty in $\alpha_{\mathrm{sig}}$, shown in Table~\ref{tab:pre-fit-stat},  is decomposed into
signal region statistics, top CR statistics and multijet CR
statistics. The contribution of the systematic uncertainties to the
total uncertainty is decomposed into the dominant components and shown in Table~\ref{tab:pre-fit-systematics}. The dominant
systematic uncertainties vary across the mass range, but some of the most relevant ones are due to $t \bar{t}$ modelling, $b$-tagging systematic uncertainties, and those related to jet measurements.

\subsection{Boosted analysis results}
\label{sec:boosted_results}
The boosted analysis applies the selection criteria described in
Section~\ref{sec:boosted_selection}. After applying the large-$R$ jet mass requirement
$90 < m_\text{Large-$R$ jet} < 140$~\GeV, the $m_{HH}$ distribution is
reconstructed and its shape is fit to data using MC
signal and background templates. The distribution is fit using 17
bins, with almost uniform width except at low and high $m_{HH}$, where
the bin width is modified in order to have a MC statistical uncertainty
%from the MC finite sample-size
smaller than 20\%. All backgrounds, except multijet, are
simulated using MC generators and normalized using the cross section of the
simulated process. The multijet background is estimated using the ABCD
method, and its normalisation obtained from this method is kept fixed in the fit. The bias due
to possible signal contamination in the ABCD regions was studied
and found to have negligible effect on the result.  The integral of the $m_{HH}$
distribution for the boosted analysis is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:event_yields_high}.

%The statistical analysis is conducted by combining the electron and muon channels into a single combined
%lepton channel.
Systematic uncertainties affecting the $m_{HH}$ shape are parameterised as linear functions of $m_{HH}$,
and the function parameters are treated as nuisance parameters in the fit. Statistical uncertainties due to the limited
sample sizes of the simulated background processes are taken into
account in the fit by means of further nuisance parameters, which are
parameterised by Poisson priors.
%In particular, one nuisance parameter is assigned to each bin in the $m_{HH}$ distribution.
 
The systematic uncertainties included in the fit are described in
Section~\ref{sec:boosted_systematics}. The contribution of the systematic uncertainties to the
total uncertainty is decomposed into the dominant components and summarized  in
Table~\ref{tab:boosed_nplist_systematics}. The most relevant
systematic uncertainties are due to the limited size of the MC
samples, the $t \bar{t}$ modelling and the $b$-tagging systematic uncertainties.

Figure~\ref{fig:boosted_postfit_mhh} shows the $m_{HH}$ distribution for
data and the background components for the boosted analysis.
Data are generally in good agreement with the background expectations within the quoted systematic errors.
The signal $m_{HH}$ distribution is shown in the figure for  the scalar resonance.
Figure~\ref{fig:boosted_only_limits} shows the observed and the expected
upper limit on the production cross section of the scalar $S$ particle.
\iffalse
The expected
sensitivity of the boosted analysis is better than the resolved one
for the mass of the resonance X ($X = S$)  $m_X> 1300$~\GeV\.

\subsection{Combined results}
Results of the two analyses are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:combined_scalar_limit} for the scalar interpretation.
The sensitivity of the boosted analysis is higher than the resolved
analysis (the expected limit being lower)  for masses larger  than 1300 GeV in the scalar interpretation.
For masses lower than these values, the limits of the resolved analysis are presented in the figure, otherwise the boosted-analysis limits are shown.
In addition, the expected limits of both analyses are shown near the mass values where the switch between the two limit curves occurs.

Finally, the observed upper limits on the production cross sections range from 5.6~pb  for $m_X=500$~\GeV\ to 0.51~pb for
$m_X=3000$~\GeV\ for the scalar signal model. No boosted analysis was
performed for the non-resonant SM signal model.
 
For the non-resonant signal hypothesis the observed (expected) upper
limit on the $\sigma(pp \to HH) \times {\mathcal{B}}(HH \to b\bar{b}WW^{\ast})$ at 95\%
CL is:
\[
\sigma(pp \to HH) \cdot {\mathcal{B}}(HH \to b\bar{b}WW^{\ast}) < 2.5 \, \left
 (2.5^{+1.0}_{-0.7} \right )  \,
{\mathrm{pb}},
\]
which corresponds to 300~(300$^{+100}_{-80}$) times the SM predicted cross section.

The switching point is chosen at the mass value where the boosted analysis becomes more sensitive than the resolved analysis. }
