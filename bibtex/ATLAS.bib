world's newest and most powerful tool for Particle Physics
research. It is designed to collide proton beams with a centre-of-mass
energy of 14 TeV and an unprecedented luminosity of 1034 cm−2 s−1. It
can also collide heavy (Pb) ions with an energy of 2.8 TeV per nucleon
and a peak luminosity of 1027 cm−2 s−1. In this paper, the machine
design is described.}
