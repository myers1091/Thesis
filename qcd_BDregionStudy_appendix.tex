\chapter{Freezing B and D Regions in QCD Estimate}
\label{app:qcd_BDregionStudy_appendix}

This appendix summarizes the study undertaken to select regions to 'freeze' the cuts in the B and D regions used in the ABCD estimation for QCD background. For each selection, the B/D values diverge 
from the value calculated at the beginning of the selection when the statistics in the B and/or D region drops significantly. To avoid large statistical errors in the normalization calculated for 
the multi-jet contribution in the A region, the yields from the B and D regions used in the ABCD calculation are frozen, i.e. no further cuts applied after the earliest cut in the selection which has
a B/D ratio consistent with the last statistically stable B/D ratio. Using this method, the multi-jet modelling is kept as close as possible to the phase space in the final signal region while taking
advantage of higher statistics earlier in the cutflow. All numbers in this study were conducted with a \ttbar normalization factor equal to 1.0, i.e. no data-driven normalization was applied to \ttbar.

The B/D ratio at the last cut in each selection have large errors (near or larger than 100\%) and are found to be unstable. The yields after freezing the B and D regions to their yields after the earliest selection cut with a B/D ratio consistent with the last statistically stable B/D ratio (after \ptbb $>$ 210 GeV for the non-resonant and low-mass selections and after \ptww $>$ 250 GeV for the high mass selection) are shown in Tables~\ref{tab:freeze_nonRes}, ~\ref{tab:freeze_lowMass}, and~\ref{tab:freeze_highMass}.

After freezing, the yields in the non-resonant \mbb control region are monotonically decreasing as expected, and the absolute statistical error on the QCD estimate in the final signal region is significantly reduced compared to the yields obtained without freezing the B and D regions.

\section{QCD Lepton Flavour Composition after Preselection Criteria for $\sigma_{d0}$ distribution}

We estimate the lepton flavour composition in the QCD sample and SM signal sample just after the preselection criteria.
By using the $\sigma_{d0}$ distribution we identify the lepton flavour and the origin of each lepton.
The majority of the muons results to be from bottom meson while most of the electrons come from photon conversion (about 70\%).
The impact of the $\sigma_{d0}$ cut on the two population is mostly independent from the lepton flavour, namely the cut
$|\sigma_{d0}| \le 2.0$ removes for muon leptons (76 $\pm$ 100)\% for QCD sample and (6.9 $\pm$ 1.1)\% for signal sample, while for the electons these fractions are (27.9 $\pm$ 5.0)\% for QCD sample and (5.7 $\pm$ 0.9)\% for signal.
The Table~\ref{tab:LepFlav} shows the complete lepton flavour composition.
