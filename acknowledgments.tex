I would like to thank my advisor Eric Torrence for giving me this opportunity and guiding me throughout my time at Oregon. Thank you to the remaining members of my committee; especially Stephanie Majewski for your mentorship over the years. Thank you to David Strom for your help during my time at CERN. And to Anne  McGinley for all of your help. Thank you to all of the post-docs who watched out for me at CERN, both with physics and life in general: Aparajita Dattagupta, Walter Hopkins, Jochen Heinrich, and Kate Whalen. Thank you to all my colleges who suffered with me:  Ben Allen, Jason Barkeloo, Johan Bonilla, Liza Brost, Tyler Burch, Elliot Parrish, Ian Snyder, Bri Stamas, Amanda Steinhebel , and Chaowaroj `Max' Wanotayaroj. \newline\newline
\indent Thank you to my family. You have always believed in me and your encouragement got me through many tough times. 
And finally and most importantly, thank you to my wife, Alison Jelden, and her family. Alison, without your support and love, I would not be where I am today.
