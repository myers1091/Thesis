\chapter{Data Samples}

In order to assure good data quality, events with bad detector
  conditions, namely where large part of the detectors were missing
  from data acquisition due to problems during a run, or when the
  performance of the detectors were affected by large noise, have been
  rejected from the data analysis. A GRL selection taken from
  data15\_13TeV.periodAllYear\_DetStatus-v79-repro20-02\_DQDefects-00-02-02\_PHYS\_StandardGRL\_All\_Good\_25ns.xml
  and data16\_13TeV.periodAllYear\_DetStatus-v88-pro20-21\_DQDefects-00-02-04\_PHYS \\ \_StandardGRL\_All\_Good\_25ns.xml
  is applied. Moreover, incomplete events or events with bad detector information are rejected.
