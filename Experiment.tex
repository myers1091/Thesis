%%Introduction
\chapter{Experimental Setup}
%ATLAS is a multipurpose detector positioned around one of the 4 primry interaction points of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC collides protons at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV, for Run 2, at a rate of approximately 600MHz.

%%Important pieces for my analysis
%ID (for tracking, track-jets, vertex ID)
%The Inner Detector (ID) consists of 4 subsystems. The Insertable B-Layer (IBL), a silicon pixel detector, a semiconductor tracker (SCT) and transition radiation tracker (TRT).
%EM and Had calorimeter (jets, electrons)
%Muon Spectrometer 
%Trigger (lots of this)
