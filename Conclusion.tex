This dissertation presented a search for anomalous production of di-Higgs events not predicted in the SM. The SM prediction for di-Higgs production was observed and no evidence for new physics was found.\newline 
A search for resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the ${b\overline{b}WW^{*}}$ decay mode is done in the ${b\overline{b}l\nu qq}$ final state using $pp$ collision data with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb\textsuperscript{-1} collected at ${\sqrt{s}}$ = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. No excess of events over the background only expectation is found. Limits are set on resonant and non-resonant production.\newline
\indent In addition to the complete analyses presented in this dissertation, an complimentary event reconstruction is presented. This new fully boosted analysis offers roughly a factor of two increase in sensitivity for the same dataset and is a promising addition to the ${HH\rightarrow b\overline{b}WW^{*}\rightarrow b\overline{b}l\nu qq}$ analysis for the full Run I analysis. \newline
