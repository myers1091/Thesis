\chapter{Improvements to the Boosted Analysis}
The boosted analysis described in chapter \cite{chap:anal} is optimized for the case where the ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ system is boosted and the ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$ system is resolved. However, at high resonant masses, one would expect both the ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ and the ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$ to be boosted. However, the semileptonic decay of the W boson pair adds an additional complication of having a lepton within the radius of a large-R jet. This chapter will describe a method for reconstructing this complex topology and the improvements it offers to the boosted, semi-leptonic ${HH\rightarrow b\overline{b}WW^{*}}$ analysis.
\section{Motivation}
The resonant analysis covers a large range of mass hypotheses, from 400 - 3000 GeV. As the resonant mass increases, the two Higgs systems become more and more collimated. Figure ~\ref{fig:dr} shows the average distance between final state partons as a function of the resonant mass for simulated HH events. The $WW$ bosons become very collimated (within ${\Delta{R} = 0.5}$) around 1000 GeV. \newline

\end{figure}
\indent On the ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ side, this is accounted for through the boosted analysis selection. Moving toward the full Run 2 analysis, it is worth while to look at the potential gain from including a boosted ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$ selection. This ``fully-boosted" analysis can be used in conjunction with the current boosted and resolved analysis to increase sensitivity and reach.\newline
%\section{Fully Boosted Analysis}
\indent The ``fully-boosted" analysis piggybacks off of the analysis presented in Chapter ~\ref{chap:anal}. This means the data and Monte Carlo Samples , object reconstruction, and trigger requirements are the same as the previously presented analysis. \newline
\section{Event Reconstruction}
Identically to the boosted analysis, section \ref{sec:Boosted}, events are reconstructed by requiring at least one reconstructed lepton. To reconstruct the ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ candidate, there should be at least one large-R jet with ${\Delta{R} > 1.0}$ from the selected lepton. The highest of these large-R jets is selected as the ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ candidate. This large-R jet is then required to have at least to track jets associated to it. Events with a ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ in the range ${30 \mathrm{GeV} < m_{\mathrm{bb}} < 300 \mathrm{GeV}}$ are retained for further analysis.\newline
\indent To reconstruct the ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$ candidate, there should be at least one large-R jet with ${\Delta{R} < 1.0}$ from the selected lepton. This large-R jet is selected as the ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$ jet candidate. Once the ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ jet has been selected, they are split into either electron or muon channel for the full reconstruction.\newline
\indent Calorimeter jets are clusters of energy that are grouped together into an object based on distances. If an electron, which deposits the majority of its energy into the calorimeter, were to fall within the radius of a calorimeter jet, its energy should be measured as part of the jet energy. Using this, it is possible to use a single large-R to measure the energy of the ${W\rightarrow qq}$ system and the electron.  With the large-R jet and the \met, it is possible to fully reconstruct the ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$ system. The neutrino is reconstructed using a similar method as in Section ~\ref{ssec:event_reco_res}. Imposing the relation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mh}
m_h^2 = (p^{\nu} + p^{\mathrm{large-R jet}})^2
\end{equation}
the neutrino $p_z$ can be reconstructed using the relations:
\[
p_E^{\nu} = E^{\nu} = \sqrt{P_T^2 + p_z^2} \quad p_x^{\nu} = P_Tcos(\phi) \quad p_y^{\nu} = P_T sin(\phi)
\]
where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle of the $\met$, $E^{\nu}$ the neutrino energy, $p_x$ and $p_y$ the two transverse spatial components of the neutrino momentum.\newline
\indent Muons do not deposit a significant amount of energy in the calorimeters, this means we cannot use the same reconstruction as the electrons. Instead, the muons are treated in a more traditional fashion. In the muon channel, the large-R jet contains the energy of the ${W\rightarrow qq}$ system. The muon is reconstructed using the MS and ID information and the neutrino is reconstructed identically to \ref{ssec:event_reco_res}, with the hadronic $W$ as a single object.\newline
\indent Figure ~\ref{fig:topo} shows a diagram of the event topology after the event reconstruction.

\caption{Diagram of the fully-boosted event topology}
\label{fig:topo}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\section{Event selection}
After the event is reconstructed, a b-tag requirement is applied to the 2 track-jets in the ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ candidate. The \met{} is required to be more than 50 GeV to reject events from QCD background. Finally a  \pt requirement is placed on the ${H\rightarrow WW^{*}}$ candidate. It is important to cut on the same physics objects. To accomplish this, an ``adjusted \pt " (${\pt^{'}}$) cut of 250 GeV is applied. Table ~\ref{tab:adjpt} defines the ${\pt^{'}}$ for both channels.

\subsection{Signal Region Definition}
As with the boosted analysis in Section ~\ref{sec:Boosted}, the ${h\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ candidate must have a jet mass in the window ${90 \mathrm{ GeV } < m_{bb} < 140 \mathrm{GeV}}$ to be considered in the signal region (SR). The previous boosted analysis included a b-jet veto for all jets outside of the ${H\rightarrow b\overline{b}}$ candidate. In order to increase statistics for the QCD multijet estimate, this was removed from the fully boosted analysis.

\subsection{mBB Control Region}
To check the modeling of the background, a control region is created with an inverted ${m_{bb}}$ cut. 
\subsection{Multijet Background}
The QCD multijet background is estimated using the same data-driven background as the boosted analysis. The ABCD method with the regions defined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Region A: \met $>$ 50 GeV, $|d_{0}^{\textrm{sig}}|$ $<$ 2.0
\item Region B: \met $<$ 50 GeV, $|d_{0}^{\textrm{sig}}|$ $<$ 2.0
\item Region C: \met $>$ 50 GeV, $|d_{0}^{\textrm{sig}}|$ $>$ 2.0
\item Region D: \met $<$ 50 GeV, $|d_{0}^{\textrm{sig}}|$ $>$ 2.0
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Statistical} 
The uncertainty on the predicted yield of the multijet background is determined by propagating the statistical uncertainty
of the $\frac{N_B^\text{QCD}}{N_D^\text{QCD}}$ ratio, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:boosted_bkgd_abcd_ratio_new}, and the statisical
uncertainty on the multijet yield in region C ($N_C^\text{QCD}$), as in Table~\ref{tab:boosted_bkgd_abcd_yield_new}.
 
\paragraph{1-tag/2-tag jet mass acceptance} 
Another source of uncertainty on the multijet yield is the  
the difference of acceptance of the large-$R$ jet mass cut between 1-tag and 2-tag.
This uncertainty is included since the template for or the multijet shape prediction uses the multijet shape
from the 1-tag region C. Table~\ref{tab:boosted_syst_qcd_norm_mBBAcc} shows the acceptance
of the large-$R$ jet mass signal and mBB control region selection in the multijet 1-tag region C and 2-tag region C yields.
The relative difference between the acceptance in 1-tag region C and in 2-tag region C is considered as an uncertainty on the normalization
of the QCD multijet prediction.

The fully-boosted analysis reconstructs the ${m_{HH}}$ distribution and the shape is fit to data using MC signal and background templates. The distribution is fit using 17
bins, with almost uniform width except at low and high $m_{HH}$%, where the bin width is modified in order to have a MC statistical uncertainty from the MC finite sample-size smaller than 20\%. 
All backgrounds, except multijet, are
simulated using MC generators and normalised using the cross section of the
simulated process. The multijet background is estimated using the ABCD
method, and its normalisation obtained from this method is kept fixed in the fit. The bias due
to possible signal contamination in the ABCD regions was studied
and found to have negligible effect on the result.  The integral of the $m_{HH}$
distribution for the boosted analysis is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:event_yields_high_new}.

\section{Conclusion}
The fully-boosted ${HH\rightarrow b\overline{b}WW^{*}}$ semi-leptonic analysis can strengthen the limit on the cross section of the resonant pair production by approximately a factor of 2 over a large range of resonant masses. \newline
\indent Several improvements can be made to the fully-boosted analysis moving toward the full Run 2 analysis. The isolated lepton trigger that is used for these studies is not suitable for highly collimated topologies and likely leads to a loss of signal efficiency at high resonant masses. A large-R jet trigger would allow for leptons much closer to other objects and could increase the number of events, especially in the high resonant mass region. Additionally, the QCD multijet estimation suffers from a lack of statistics in the C and D regions. This gives a large error on the QCD background estimation. A different method of QCD estimation, such as the matrix method, may be more suitable.\newline
\indent The fully-boosted analysis can be combined with the previous resolved and boosted analysis for the full Run-2 search. By using all three regions, it is possible to maximize the reach of the analysis across the entire mass range, even extending the range higher.
